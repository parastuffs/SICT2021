## Ideas for didactic material to raise awareness in students.

- List chemicals and ask them which they think is actually used in producing the components they used in the labs.
They could then raise the question about alternatives, which would need to be investigated.
Another question could thus be: Is it sustainable to use actual components rather than just simulating everything.

- Sustainability is not just production an environment, what about longevity and support?
Defend the case for open source hardware, in particular for microprocessor architectures.

- LCA of a discrete transistor vs. logic gate IC. We gain space by going toward smaller ICs, but are they more sustainable?
One of the first answers is repairability. Discrete components can be replaced individualy, whilst intagrated circuits form a whole as a design.
