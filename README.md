## Ideas for didactic material to raise awareness in students.

- List chemicals and ask them which they think is actually used in producing the components they used in the labs.
They could then raise the question about alternatives, which would need to be investigated.
Another question could thus be: Is it sustainable to use actual components rather than just simulating everything.

- Sustainability is not just production an environment, what about longevity and support?
Defend the case for open source hardware, in particular for microprocessor architectures.

- SIMD is more performant, but is it always more sustainable? Do the sub-circuits implementing those instructions more energy-efficient?

- LCA of a discrete transistor vs. logic gate IC. We gain space by going toward smaller ICs, but are they more sustainable?
One of the first answers is repairability. Discrete components can be replaced individualy, whilst intagrated circuits form a whole as a design.
FPGA vs ASIC

- How raise awareness to students?
	- During labs
	- Thinking back on what they did afterwards, or teach beforehand so that they think while they work?

- Gamification
	- Kahoot
	- Wooclap

- Toolsets ready to use:
	- slides
	- achievements
	- Shared, growing
	- Resources (LCA, databases, rebound effect)
	- Idea about how to hold a sustainable cafe, hackaton, events in general
	- **Need to find a name**

- Metrics to assess the success of our tools.
	- Polls before and after
	- Sustainability coffee

- Polls
	- The energy consumption is growing exponentially, how would you change that? (Challenge preconceptions about rebound effect)

## After critics
Keep our toolset focused on engineers, but make a template available to ease forking toward another specific audience.
